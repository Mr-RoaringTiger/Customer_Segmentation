# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Description
This project involves customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The analysis is demonstrated through a Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Link:** [Mall Customer Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

## Model
- **Algorithm:** KMeans Clustering

## Current Status
The provided Streamlit app currently supports segmentation for the specific dataset only. Work is ongoing to generalize the model for other datasets.

## Important
Focus on the Jupyter Notebook (`Customer_Segmentation_Analysis.ipynb`) for the detailed analysis.

## Imports
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `joblib`
- `streamlit` (for app)
